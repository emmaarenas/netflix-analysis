## Viewing and Editing Notebooks

The `Jupyter Notebooks` in this repository **can be viewed directly on GitHub**, which allows for easy review of the analysis and outcomes without the need for local execution. For an interactive experience or to modify the analysis, it is recommended to **clone the repository** and work with the notebooks locally.

If you wish to execute or edit the notebooks on your own machine, ensure you have an **R distribution installed**, along with the **packages mentioned in the notebooks**. Jupyter users will need to install `IRKernel` to enable the execution of `R` within this environment.
